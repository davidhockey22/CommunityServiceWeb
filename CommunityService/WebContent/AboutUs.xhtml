					<b>Brief History:</b> I was born and raised in Orlando, Florida. I attended Edgewater Highschool in an engineering science and technology magnet,
					which is where I discovered my interest in computers. I have played ice hockey since I was 10 years old, playing competitively on a travel team
					for 7 years. I am currently 21 years old. <br /> <b>Currently:</b> I am attending the University of Central Florida majoring in Computer
					Science, working on my bachelors degree. I also work for Air IT, as a Software Engineering intern. <br /> <b>Future:</b> I want to develop
					software. I don't care where it is but I want to be challenged every day. After enough years of field experiece, I would like to make my own
					small software company.
